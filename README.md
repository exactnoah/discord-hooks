# Discord Hooks
Houses discord webhooks with secrets management, various api endpoint integrations, node.js, and github actions workflows.

## Current Bots
- **Conservatory** - Daily quote bot for the Conservatory server (currently disabled)
- **Virtual Void** - Randomly sends either a daily quote or xkcd comic to the Virtual Void server
- **SUAGTFO** - Daily quote bot (currently disabled)
- **CS4760** - Comic Chaos bot for the CS4760 capstone server (posts random xkcd comics with profanity filtering)

## Build Info for other Technical Users
- **daily-quote.yml** is the consolidated pipeline for all bots. You can add your bot api webhook as an environment variable and pass it to your scripts. 
- Add a producer for whatever bot you integrate (see dailyQuote.js and comicChaos.js for examples).
- If you want to interact with an external API, you can use `fetch` and hit whatever api you want. I have examples that get daily quotes in JSON or pull from xkcd's API.
- You can modify whatever bot you use. All bots have a webhook (discord integration; this is the environment variable), username, avatarURL (profile picture), logfile, and boolean for resetting their identities in case discord bugs out.
- **Profanity filtering**: The Comic Chaos bot includes content filtering that checks xkcd comics against a profanity list (src/assets/en.json) and skips comics containing inappropriate content.
- **Random comics**: Comics are selected randomly from the entire xkcd catalog rather than always showing the latest.
- package.json is a node package where you'll need to run your script.
*note:* the github workflow passes it to a server agent in a virtual machine which they create and destroy for you upon request. This particular app, is on a schedule. (~9:00am). The node (node.js) is a javascript runtime environment which is a fancy word for a javascript application that lets you run whatever scripts you want as long as you adhere to their schema.

## Instructions for Public Use

Anyone else wanting to use this should fork and clone their project, adding their webhook as an environment variable.
Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.

To operate this, you will need to modify the code to enable the bots of your choosing in a fork with the corresponding webhooks they wish to use.
